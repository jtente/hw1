      <p>Born and raised in Rhode Island, I know firsthand about the vibrant and authentic food scene in the Ocean State.  Often overlooked due to its proximity to Boston and New York, Providence and the rest of the state is home to some of the best restaurants on the East Coast.  After moving to Chicago in 2014, I realized that RI’s culinary competence is one of the best kept secrets of the state. Don’t let its small size fool you! Resturants, beaches, mansions and ocean views - this little state has a lot to offer!</p>
